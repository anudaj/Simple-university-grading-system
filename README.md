# Simple-university-grading-system

## Overview
This Python-based project for the Software Development I module is designed to predict university students' academic progression outcomes. It calculates whether a student will progress, trail modules, retrieve modules, or be excluded based on the input credits for Pass, Defer, and Fail categories, according to predefined university regulations. The program includes input validation, supports multiple student evaluations per session, and generates a histogram of outcomes for visual analysis. Extensions to the project allow for storing and retrieving data using various data structures, showcasing practical application of Python programming skills in solving real-world problems.
